# NOTE: AuthorizationPolicies are NOT deployed yet
# Enable incrementally per-namespace after testing with PERMISSIVE mTLS
#
# Rollout plan:
# 1. First verify mTLS is working (istioctl proxy-status)
# 2. Enable policies on one low-risk namespace (tingle-tuner)
# 3. Verify apps still work
# 4. Roll out to remaining namespaces
#
# Uncomment resources as you enable each namespace:

resources: []
# Common policies (applied to all meshed namespaces)
# - allow-gateway-ingress.yaml
# Per-namespace policies (uncomment as you enable)
# - gossip-stone/
# - tingle-tuner/
# - temple-of-time/
# - swift-sail/

### remove the base portainer install on pirates-wdda which was migrated to harbormaster


### add to the configuration of mailcow (/mnt/app_data/Server/_docker_stack/mailcow-dockerized/data/conf/unbound/unbound.conf) the dns forwarding additions (at the end of the file)
```
forward-zone:
  name: "."
  forward-addr: 10.0.0.1
  forward-addr: 10.0.0.2
  forward-addr: 1.1.1.1
  forward-addr: 8.8.8.8
  ```
In the dns hosts make sure systemd-resolved.service does not prevent docker from starting when adguard is intended to be ran for dns with the same port... ~ dependency on dependency scenario. 😁
sudo systemctl start systemd-resolved.service # I accidentally stopped this before starting adguard... Is this absolutely necessary?
docker container start adguard
sudo systemctl stop systemd-resolved.service


In the monitoring-agents, loki-docker-driver detect for if the driver not being enabled on run causes the whole docker service/socket disconnect.
then resolve it by removing the loki driver stuff from /etc/docker/daemon.json
sudo systemctl start docker.socket
sudo systemctl start docker.service
then replace the desired docker.daemon config.
sudo systemctl restart docker

## 🎯 **IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN TO FREE 3 CPU CORES**

### Phase 1: Personal Apps - Per-Pod CPU Optimization (750m freed)
1. **Open-WebUI**: 1,500m → 750m (-750m)
   - Keep 3 replicas (HA maintained)
   - Reduce CPU request per pod: 500m → 250m
2. **AppFlowy Cloud**: 1,000m → 300m (-700m)
   - AppFlowy: 500m → 200m per pod
   - Minio: 500m → 100m per pod

### Phase 2: Business Apps - Per-Pod CPU Optimization (750m freed)
3. **ERPNext Sites**: 500m → 250m (-250m)
   - App server CPU request reduction
4. **InvoiceNinja App**: 500m → 250m (-250m)
   - App server CPU request reduction
5. **OrangeHRM**: 500m → 250m (-250m)
   - App server CPU request reduction

### Phase 3: Game Server Manager - Per-Pod CPU Optimization (250m freed)
6. **Pelican Panel**: 500m → 250m (-250m)
   - Game server manager CPU request reduction

**TOTAL AVAILABLE: 1,750m (1.75 cores) from per-pod optimization WITHOUT reducing replica counts**

**NOTE:** Additional optimizations can be considered on a per-application basis if more CPU is needed. All recommendations maintain current replica counts and HA configurations.

---

## Notes for Future Optimization

1. **GitLab** (3.9 cores): User wants to keep as-is (CI platform)
2. **Security tools** (Wazuh, CrowdSec): Keep untouched (critical)
3. **Infrastructure** (Vault, Zitadel, Ceph): Keep untouched (critical)
4. **Replica counts**: Maintained for HA - user switched from Docker to K8s for BETTER availability
5. **Per-pod optimization**: Focus on reducing CPU/memory requests per pod, not replica counts

## How to Use This Document

1. **Planning**: Review before deploying new apps
2. **Optimization**: Identify over-provisioned apps
3. **Troubleshooting**: When pods can't schedule (like Kafka brokers 3-4)
4. **Capacity Planning**: Track total resource usage vs cluster capacity

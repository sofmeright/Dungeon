- Repository Information:
  - Git repository: ssh://git@10.30.1.123:2424/precisionplanit/dungeon
  - Repository name: dungeon (formerly ant_parade-public)

- CRITICAL RULES:
  - Prefer using flux to reconcile resources from source. We are GitOps native, we use kubectl commands to adjust state only when it is otherwise impossible!!!!!
  - When working with files in source control, make clean moves that dont create a headache of files!!!!
  - STAY ON TASK when following directions. NO BAND AID, NO FUCKING WORK AROUNDS. IF YOU THINK WE NEED TO GIVE UP or regroup and re-evaluate. ASK. DONT MAKE THE CALL ON YOUR OWN to find alternative solutions or FIND A SHORTCUT. I CAN FIND MY OWN WAYS TO BASTARDIZE THINGS I DONT NEED YOUR FUCKING HELP. I want things done exactly how I ask. If I am to be offered an alternative conversation should stop till I tell you if I agree/disagree with the alternative proposed.

- FluxCD Infrastructure Structure:
  - `fluxcd/infrastructure/controllers/base` should contain TEMPLATED infrastructure resources WITHOUT any environment-specific values including: no hardcoded namespaces, image tags, replicas, storage classes, LoadBalancer IPs, cluster-specific annotations (lbipam.cilium.io/*), domain names, URLs, etc.
  - `fluxcd/infrastructure/controllers/overlays/production` should contain ALL environment-specific infrastructure configurations and patches for the production cluster: LoadBalancer IPs, cluster-specific annotations, domain names, storage classes, etc.
  - **NAMESPACE MANAGEMENT STANDARD**: All infrastructure overlays MUST use kustomization-level `namespace:` field (standard kustomize pattern):
    - Base resources: NO namespace metadata anywhere
    - Overlay kustomization.yaml: `namespace: <target-namespace>` field at kustomization level
    - Kustomize automatically adds namespace to all resources
    - Critical for infrastructure: Avoids conflicts between FluxCD namespace (flux-system) and target deployment namespace (kube-system, etc.)
  - `fluxcd/infrastructure/configs` should only provide secrets and configuration values
  - `fluxcd/infrastructure/namespaces` manages all Kubernetes namespaces - ALL namespaces MUST be deployed via this path only
    - Namespaces (Ocarina of Time theme):
      - tingle-tuner: Tools and utilities (quirky helper character)
      - zeldas-lullaby: Administrative services (vault, weave, zitadel)
      - compass: DNS & NTP services (navigation/direction)
      - gossip-stone: Monitoring services (tells you secrets/info)
      - lost-woods: Discovery & Dashboards (exploration/finding things)
      - temple-of-time: Archival/Content Management & Media Servers (linkwarden, calibre-web, mealie, plex)
      - fairy-bottle: Backup services (velero, urbackup - restores/saves state)
      - gorons-bracelet: Storage services (minio, longhorn, rook-ceph - provides strength/lifting power)
      - arylls-lookout: Gateway for internal-only services (xylem replacement)
      - kokiri-forest: Gateway for personal/public services (phloem replacement)
      - hyrule-castle: Gateway for business/work services (cell-membrane replacement)
  - Base should NEVER contain deployment-ready configs - only generic templates that overlays patch with real values. Base should document application defaults from upstream/vendor documentation, not production-specific configurations.
  - Always use overlays/production for actual deployment to the production cluster, never deploy from base

- Secret Management Strategy:
  - Critical infrastructure apps (vault, zitadel, etc.) use SOPS for secret management so they can run with local auth without dependencies during cluster issues
  - **CRITICAL: Never edit .enc.yaml files directly!** These are SOPS-encrypted files. Direct editing corrupts them and destroys secrets permanently. Always use `sops` command to decrypt, edit plaintext, then re-encrypt.
  - Most other applications use Vault External Secrets Operator to manage secrets from Vault at http://172.22.30.102:8200/ui/vault/secrets/operationtimecapsule/kv/list
  - Vault secret path structure in operationtimecapsule namespace:
    - `apps/<app-name>` - bundled comprehensive secrets specific to that application (e.g., apps/linkwarden)
    - `smtp/<service-name>` - SMTP-related secrets that may be shared between applications (e.g., smtp/ofcourseimvegan)
    - `smb/<share-name>` - SMB/storage secrets that may be shared between applications (e.g., smb/media-books-rw)
    - Shared paths (smtp/, smb/) are for secrets used by multiple applications, app-specific paths (apps/) are for single application use
- FluxCD App Structure:
  - `fluxcd/apps/base/<app>/` contains TEMPLATED Kubernetes resources WITHOUT any environment-specific values including: no hardcoded namespaces, image tags, replicas, storage classes, LoadBalancer IPs, cluster-specific annotations (lbipam.cilium.io/*), domain names, URLs, etc. These are reusable templates across environments.
  - `fluxcd/apps/overlays/production/<app>/` references the base (`../../../base/<app>`) and contains ALL environment-specific configurations via patches: namespace, image tags, replica counts, storage classes, LoadBalancer configurations, ingress configs, domain names, URLs, cluster-specific annotations, etc. for the production cluster.
  - **NAMESPACE MANAGEMENT STANDARD**: All overlays MUST use kustomization-level `namespace:` field (standard kustomize pattern):
    - Base resources: NO namespace metadata anywhere
    - Overlay kustomization.yaml: `namespace: <target-namespace>` field at kustomization level
    - Kustomize automatically adds namespace to all resources
    - **CRITICAL**: Use `patches:` field ONLY - `patchesStrategicMerge` is deprecated by FluxCD
    - Benefits: Standard kustomize behavior, clean and simple, no complex patches needed
  - Base should NEVER contain deployment-ready configs - only generic templates that overlays patch with real values. Base should document application defaults from upstream/vendor documentation, not production-specific configurations. If you see cluster-specific IPs, domains, or annotations in base, they must be moved to overlay patches.
  - Other environments (staging, dev) can inherit the same base with different overlays.
  - Never deploy directly from base - always use overlays for actual deployments.
- Cluster initialization is handled by bash\_importing_from_sibling_repo\bootstrap-k8s-install-dependencies.sh bootstrap-k8s-initialize-control-plane.sh and a reset script. No other manipulation should be needed for initial cluster setup.

- Stateful sets should be used for PVCs that are for stateful applications! Deployments should only be used when the applications state doesnt need to be kept!

- PersistentVolume Naming Standard:
  - PVC names created via StatefulSet volumeClaimTemplates MUST follow this pattern: `<namespace>-<app>-<purpose>-<replica-number>`
  - Components:
    - `<namespace>`: The Kubernetes namespace (e.g., temple-of-time, lost-woods, gossip-stone)
    - `<app>`: The application name (e.g., plex, homarr, linkwarden, mealie)
    - `<purpose>`: Descriptive purpose/type identifying what the volume stores
      - For databases: Use specific DB type (postgres, mysql, sqlite, redis) NOT generic "database" or "data"
      - For storage: Use descriptive purpose (config, images, media, transcode, cache, storage)
    - `<replica-number>`: StatefulSet replica index (0, 1, 2, etc.)
  - Examples:
    - `temple-of-time-plex-config-0` - Plex configuration
    - `temple-of-time-plex-transcode-0` - Plex transcoding cache
    - `temple-of-time-mealie-postgres-0` - Mealie's PostgreSQL database
    - `lost-woods-homarr-sqlite-0` - Homarr's SQLite database
    - `lost-woods-homarr-images-0` - Homarr image storage
    - `gossip-stone-loki-storage-0` - Loki log storage

- Traefik & Gateway API Routing Strategy:
  - **IP-based Domain Isolation**: Use separate Gateway resources with unique LoadBalancer IPs to enable firewall-based internet exposure control (pfSense NAT rules per IP)
  - **Gateway Architecture**:
    - **xylem-gateway** (172.22.30.69, sharing-key: arylls-lookout): Internal-only services (*.pcfae.com) - NO pfSense port forward = internal only, can be enabled on-demand
    - **phloem-gateway** (172.22.30.70, sharing-key: kokiri-forest): Personal/public services (*.sofmeright.com, *.arbitorium.com, *.yesimvegan.com) - pfSense forwards port 443
    - **cell-membrane-gateway** (172.22.30.71, sharing-key: hyrule-castle): Business/work services (*.precisionplanit.com, *.prplanit.com, *.optcp.com, *.ipleek.com, *.uni2.cc) - pfSense forwards port 443
  - Each Gateway has its own:
    - Unique LoadBalancer IP via `lbipam.cilium.io/ips` annotation
    - Dedicated TLS certificate (cert-manager + Let's Encrypt)
    - Wildcard hostname listener for its domain(s)
  - HTTPRoutes reference the appropriate Gateway via `parentRefs` and hostname matching
  - Firewall (pfSense) controls public/private exposure via port forward rules per Gateway IP
  - Benefits: Same nginx-extras isolation model, firewall-controlled exposure, k8s-native routing

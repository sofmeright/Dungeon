# Fix Ceph RBD Volume Unmount Shutdown Hang
#
# Ceph RBD volumes with ext4 filesystems can hang indefinitely during shutdown
# because the ext4 journal tries to write to RBD devices that are already
# disconnected. This happens on ALL Kubernetes nodes with Ceph RBD volumes.
#
# This script adds systemd overrides to:
# 1. Reduce default mount TimeoutStopSec from 90s to 30s
# 2. Force lazy unmount for stuck kubelet mounts
#
# Usage:
#   ./k8s-fix-ceph-rbd-shutdown-hang.sh <node-hostname>

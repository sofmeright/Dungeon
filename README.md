# Ad Arbitorium (Datacenter): Private Repository

This repository describes the active environment of Ad Arbitorium datacenter. Ideally all necessary configuration shall be maintained within this repo unless it would be better stored in a docker volume or within local resources.

### Automations:

**Storage**: Our ansible playbooks and tasks are stored in [our gitlab in the Ad Arbitorium üîê repo](https://gitlab.prplanit.com/SoFMeRight/ad-arbitorium-private).

**ansible-semaphore**: We use semaphore as an interface to execute some automation tasks from a web-ui.

**ideas**: I am considering implementing olivetin, cronguru, or perhaps making a custom cli to select tasks that are desired to be ran.

**Repository Backups**  

- ant-parade & leaf-cutter - If something bad happens, we always cache a current copy of the repository. </br>
    - If the cluster is dead we can still run ansible from leaf-cutter:    
    ```docker run -v /srv/gitops/ad-arbitorium-private:/srv/gitops/ad-arbitorium-private -v ~/.ssh/id_rsa:/root/.ssh/id_rsa --rm cr.pcfae.com/prplanit/ansible:2.18.6 ansible-playbook --private-key /root/.ssh/id_rsa -i /srv/gitops/ad-arbitorium-private/ansible/inventory /srv/gitops/ad-arbitorium-private/ansible/infrastructure/qemu-guest-agent-debian.yaml```

### Backup Schedule:
> The industry we are in is usually active around 6:00AM-10:00PM PST tops. Other times might be business critical hours, but here we are considering the peak of the day.

```mon,fri 22:00``` Proxmox backups of NAS & PBS to *local-zfs* 

```tue,thu,fri 23:00``` Proxmox backups of all other core/essential VMs to *Flashy-Fuscia-SSD* 

### Hardware Overview:

> Ad Arbitorium Datacenter is comprised of *5 nodes clustered* with PVE, Proxmox Virualization Environment.

1. Avocado
    - CPU: 2 x Intel Xeon E5-2680 v3 ```24C/48T | 2.5GHz/3.30GHz | 240Watt```
    - RAM: 256 GB ```8/16 DIMMs x 32 GB ECC Mem```

2. Bamboo
    - CPU: 2 x Intel Xeon E5-2680 v4 ```28C/56T | 2.4GHz/3.30GHz | 240Watt```
    - RAM: 96 GB ```6/16 DIMMs x 16 GB ECC Mem```

3. Cosmos
    - CPU: 2 x Intel Xeon E5-2667 v3 ```16C/32T 3.2GHz/3.60GHz 270Watt```
    - RAM: 256 GB ```8/16 DIMMs x 32 GB ECC Mem```

4. Dragonfruit
    - CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 2700x ```8C/16T | 3.7GHz/4.35GHz | 105Watt```
    - RAM: 64 GB ```2/4 DIMMs x 32 GB ECC Mem```

5. Eggplant
    - CPU: 2 x Intel Xeon E5-2683 v3 ```28C/56T | 2.00GHz/3.00GHz | 240Watt```
    - RAM: 128 GB ```16/24 DIMMs x 8 GB ECC Mem```

6. (leaf-cutter) 
    - CPU: Intel i7-4720HQ (8) @ 3.600GHz 
    - RAM: 16 GB ```2/2 DIMMs x 8 GB DDR3? Mem
    - Note: This is an unclustered automations machine which serves as a backup for if things ever get hairy. Hopefully as close to a replica of ant-parade as possible.

### Observability/Monitoring Overview:

*Grafana/Loki/Prometheus*

*Beszel*

*Portainer*

### Networking Overview:

1. *Firewalls / Routing*: 2 pfSense Firewalls are spun up on Avocado and Bamboo with HA/CARP for stable WAN.

*Modem*

*Switches*

*OSPFv6 for Proxmox and Ceph Networking*

*BGP Kubernetes Setup*

*HA Proxy K8S API Load Balancing*

2. *DNS*: AdguardHome and AdguardHome sync docker containers within 2 VMs provides highly available DNS.

3. *Reverse Proxies*: Domains like sofmeright.com are exposed through 3 public IPs which are handled by NGINX reverse proxy services running on three distinct VMs cell-membrane, phloem, and xylem; the third has no port forwarding which creates an isolated internal web domain @ pcfae.com.

### RDP / Remote Control:

*rustdesk/moonlight/sunshine/tactical-rmm*

### Workloads (main):

*PVE* - The host OS on the main 5 nodes is PVE. Within PVE we have many guest VMs. 

*Ubuntu 24.04LTS + Docker* - The majority of our workload is managed with docker containers within Ubuntu 24.04LTS VMs. One of these hosts, Dock does have discrete GPU access.

*pfSense* - I would rather see opnSense in these 2 VMs that handle our networking needs, but the ipv4/6 dual stack networking portion of this config was not working under opnSense as of a test months before this commit.

*3Cx* - VOIP phone system.

*Home-Assistant OS*

*Kubernetes* - Deployed a 5 master/worker kubeadm cluster utilizing Ubuntu 22.04LTS. Plan on removing 2 masters due to recommendations from many kubernetes users I am connected with sharing more than 3 masters at this scale is excessive.

*Monitoring/Observability/IDS/IPS* - Lighthouse, a VM dedicated to these purposes runs Beszel, Crowdsec, Grafana, Loki, Prometheus, Wazuh. Agents pull data from most hosts. The pfsense instances have crowdsec bouncers configured to block malicious traffic upon detection.

*PBS*

*Portainer Management* - Harbormaster VM serves as a jump server for the portainer instances.

*Shinobi* - Security Camera software.

*TrueNAS*

*Windows Server / Active Directory* - Deployed a 3 machine forest.

### VPN:

*Netbird*

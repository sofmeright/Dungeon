# Ant_Parade-Public
This repository is responsible for *deployment* of **Kubernetes** Environments and Workloads that are actively managed by SoFMeRight.

This repository is public space, however it is not a product. As such you can depend on its availability on some level as this code is slotted to become essential to SoFMeRight's homelab. However the code contained within this repository is without warranty, you are welcome to raise issues if you wish; no guarantee of any outcome as result however. Having a lab without issues is ideal so it is likely for issues to be addressed. But the scope of this repo is from business to personal and as such it is very paricular the way in which an outside entity might influence the development of this repo. At the very least/especially in these early stages! That being said, if you the person reading this so happen not to be SoFMeRight or internal to PrPlanIT, we don't mean to scare you away! WELCOME to SoFMeRight's K8s lab ~ WIP! Hope you enjoy your stay! üëãüèΩ
